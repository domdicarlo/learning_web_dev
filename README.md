## Learning how to do web development.

<s>I am mostly following a udemy tutorial on here, wanting to do full stack with django, html, css, and js.</s>

I am playing around with different tutorials and guides and documenting my progress here.

I have dabbled in JS at this point. I have played with python, but don't really have it as a language I am comfortable with at this point. So, I thought this would be an ideal way to get started.

As of starting this (8.23.19), there is not much of a file system heirarchy, so if it's chaotic in here understand it's all part of my learning process :)
